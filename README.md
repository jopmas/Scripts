# Scripts for Mandyoc #

This repository contains `.py `, `.ipynb` and `.sh` scripts to be used to deal with Mandyoc data ([`Sacek et al., 2022`](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.04070)).

The most important scripts and notebeooks are presented bellow:
<!-- * The [`.`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/.) -->

## .ipynb notebooks ##
The aim os this scripts is to post process the mandyoc data with the control that notebook offers.

* The [`Numerical_setup.ipynb`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/Numerical_setup.ipynb) script creates a plot with the main characteriscts of the experiment.
  
* The [`isotherm_evolution.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/isotherm_evolution.sh) script extracts and plot the mean depth evolution of 0, 500, 800, 1000 and 1300 oC isotherms from a Mandyoc scenario.

* The [`Korenaga_Fig5_custom.py`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/Korenaga_Fig5_custom.py) script plot the relationship with mantle potential temperature and tectonic style using data from Fig. 5b from [Korenaga (2013)](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-earth-050212-124208). 

## .py scritps ##
The aim os this scripts is to automate some post processing work.

* The [`generate_input_files_database.py`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/generate_input_files_database.py) create the needed input files according to type of geodynamical experiments

* The [`create_database`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/create_database.py) create a Xarray database from all ASCII outputs generated by Mandyoc.

* The [`lr_map_structs.py`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/lr_map_structs.py) map the evolution of coastal escarpments formed in the rifting scenarios.

* The [`isotherms_evolution_extractor.py`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/isotherms_evolution_extractor.py) script extracts and plot the mean depth evolution of 0, 500, 800, 1000 and 1300 oC isotherms from a Mandyoc scenario.

## shell scritps ##
* The aim os this scripts is to automate the compression of mandyoc files (ASCII and plots)

* The [`zipper.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/zipper.sh) script zip both ASCII and plots of Mandyoc outputs.

* The [`make_video.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/make_video.sh) script creates .mp4 videos from png plots of Mandyoc outputs.

* The [`zip_plots.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/zip_plots.sh) script zips the .png, .mp4 and .gifs outputs generated by [`frames generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/jamisonassuncao/mandyoc-scripts/blob/master/frames_generator.ipynb).

* The [`clear_outputs.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/clear_outputs.sh) script deletes the ASCII Mandyoc outputs.

* The [`clear_plots.sh`](https://github.com/jopmas/scripts/blob/master/clear_plots.sh) script deletes the .png plots created by [`frames generator.ipynb`](https://github.com/jamisonassuncao/mandyoc-scripts/blob/master/frames_generator.ipynb).

# Conda environment #

Extracted from [`README.md`](https://github.com/jamisonassuncao/mandyoc-scripts/blob/main/README.md) file of [`mandyoc-scripts`](https://github.com/jamisonassuncao/mandyoc-scripts/tree/main) repository.

The scripts were built with [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) and its environment `mpy` can be replicated with [`conda`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html) by using
```
conda env create --file=environment.yml
```

Once installed, the environment can be accessed by activating it with
```
conda activate mpy
```

The code is built on top of [`Agustina Pesces`](https://github.com/aguspesce)' codes.
